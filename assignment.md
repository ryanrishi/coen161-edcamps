Introduction
===
EdCamps Inc is an organization that offers educational summer camps for children aged 10-14 across the country. The camps are offered in summer months and each camp is for 2 weeks. Each camp location is identified by a name, for example, EdCamps_SantaClara. The actual camp site may be different from where the camp office is located. Each camp offers activities, in two categories, namely, computer-based activities and outdoor activities. Children can enroll for 1 or 2 weeks. The organization also sells camp-related items like books, back-packs, T-shirts etc, on line from their website. Anyone can buy their items and students signed up for camps get a 15% discount on items.
You are required to design and develop a website for EdCamps.
The website must support the following services:
- Provide a description of EdCamps Inc’s philosophy, their services, their location(s), relevant pictures and links to related pages.
- Provide a list of schedule of camps and a description of activities in camps. The schedule should include the dates and locations of the camps and activities in each camp.
- Provide a form to allow parents to register their children in camps.
- Provide a form to buy the camp items from their website.
- Provide a forum for members (parents whose children have attended the camp) to post their comments/reviews and suggestions.
